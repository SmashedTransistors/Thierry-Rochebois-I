# Thierry-Rochebois-I
Teensy4.1 based Transdimensional Synthesizer number one.

## Transdimensional ?
Transdimensional is a fancy name for a way to simplify the use of very complicated synthesis algorithm.
It is a kind of morphing that takes care of navigating through the synthesis parameter hyperspace.
Thierry-Rochebois-I navigates in a 54 dimension hyperspace.

## Thierry-Rochebois-I-alpha000
It is my first github publication for almost 5 years (I was pretty active with the Axoloti then).
With alpha000 you already have 7 presets available (through midi program changes). 
They are based on a recreation of classic waveforms and hardsync.

I will add more details about the hardware options and the various Midi controls this week end.
