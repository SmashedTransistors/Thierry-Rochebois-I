# Thierry-Rochebois-I
Teensy4.1 based Transdimensional Morphing Synthesizer number one.

**You only need a Teensy4.1 and a I2S audio DAC to try it.**

## Transdimensional ?
_Transdimensional_ is a fancy name for a way to simplify the use of very complicated synthesis algorithm.
It is a kind of morphing that takes care of navigating through the synthesis parameter hyperspace.
_Thierry-Rochebois-I_ navigates in a 54 dimension hyperspace.

## Features

- 8 voice polyphony
- 96kHz sample rate (for a brighter sound and controlled aliasing)
- Morphing based synthesis 
- 32 "morphemes"
  - a starting point consists of a pair of morphemes
  - the ending point consists of another pair of morphemes
- Reverberation
- Chorus
- CC control of synthesis parameters
- Presets through Midi Program Changes ( 15 presets already available on version alpha001).


## Thierry-Rochebois-I

Yes, it's my real name. It can seem weird to name a synth after myself... but that's an easy way to avoid
troubles with trademarks. I had many funny names in mind but most of them would have been a cause of conflict
with existing products.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Versions
### Thierry-Rochebois-I-alpha001
Updates :
- 8 new presets
- all 32 "morphemes" are now implemented
- Triangle or Sine based engine (so that analogish and FMish sounds are possible)
- support for Pitch Bend (+- 2 semitones)
- if an APC25Key II is attached the presets can be accessed through "shift+pad"

### Thierry-Rochebois-I-alpha000
It is my first GitHub publication for almost 5 years (I was pretty active with the Axoloti then). I discovered the
Teensy4.1 a year ago.
With alpha000 you already have 7 presets available (through midi program changes). 
They are based on a recreation of classic waveforms and hardsync.

I will add more details about the hardware options and the various Midi controls this week end.

## Configurations
### Base
**You only need a Teensy4.1 and a I2S audio DAC to try it...** 

and if you like it you can add some goodies if you want to go further.
### Options
- OLED SH1106 (for oscilloscope and parameter display) 
- Midi Din (on RX1)
- Akai APC25 Mk2 on USBHost for direct sound editing.
- Secondary I2S audio DAC for symetrical outputs.

![a Teensy4.1 and an I2S DAC](./photos/Minimal_UDA1334.jpg)
This DAC does not need a master clock, it has its own PLL to generate it based on the LRCLK1 (WSEL).
So this input is very sensitive to transients. To avoid issues, simply add a 100ohm resistor on the input of the breakout 
(it will prevent inductive/capacitive oscillations).

### Teensy4.1 to PCM5102A Breakout 
They are quite cheap and high quality dacs.
Most breakouts already have resistors on their inputs to avoid inductive oscillations.
The optional SCK must be grounded by adding a solder blob.

## Morph Function
Without morph modulation, the morphing from [A0,B0] to [A1,B1] is controlled by the modwheel.
With Morph Mod Depth `CC18` part of the morphing will be controlled by the Morph Function Generator which provides 8 different functions selected by `CC77`
