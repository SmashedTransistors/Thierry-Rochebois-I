# TR-I Morphing Synthesizer
Teensy4.1 based Transdimensional Morphing Synthesizer number one.

**You only need a Teensy4.1 and a I2S audio DAC to try it.**

**Add a SH1106 OLED and a USB Host adapter and you can use an Akai APC25Key Mark II for direct control**

## Features

- Morphing based synthesis
- 8 voice polyphony
- 32 "morphemes"
    - a starting point consists of a pair of morphemes
    - the ending point consists of another pair of morphemes
- core synth engine based on dual hard synched phase modulation (2x3 operators) with multiple feedbacks, detunes and chaotic generators (the "morphemes" take care of that) and a two pole resonant low pass filter.
- 96kHz sample rate (for a brighter sound and controlled aliasing)
- Optional balanced output mode (using two I2S dacs) for better quality
- Reverberation
- Chorus
- CC control of synthesis parameters
- Presets through Midi Program Changes (20 presets available on version alpha003).
- Possible direct control of the synthesis engine with an [Akai APC key 25 mk2](https://www.akaipro.com/apc-key-25-mkii.html)
- Display on a 1"33 SH1106 or 2"42 SSD1309 OLED (scope and parameters)
- MIDI sources:
    - USB device port (computer)
    - USB Host (from a Akai APC key 25 mk2)
    - MIDI Din (H11L1 optocoupler on RX1)

## Transdimensional ?
_Transdimensional_ is a fancy name for a way to simplify the use of very complicated synthesis algorithm.
It is a kind of morphing that takes care of navigating through the synthesis parameter hyperspace.
_Thierry-Rochebois-I_ navigates in a 54 dimension hyperspace.



## TR-I (Thierry-Rochebois-I)

I had many funny names in mind but most of them would have been a cause of conflict
with existing products.
Feels weird to name a synth after myself... but that's the easy way to avoid
troubles with trademarks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Versions

The project is still in its alpha stages (that means that some implementations can
evolve).
[Here is the info about the occuring alpha versions](./Versions.md)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Configurations

I designed this project so that you can test it with a very small configuration
and add what you want.

### Base
**You only need a Teensy4.1 and a I2S audio DAC to try it...**
It will be responsive to note Ons, Program Changes and control Changes from your PC/Daw.

I coded a little preset editor so that you can edit and flash your own presets in EEPROM.

![Editor](./pictures/Editor.png)

and if you like it you can add some goodies if you want to go further.
### Options
- OLED SH1106 (for oscilloscope and parameter display)
- Midi Din (on RX1)
- Akai APC25 Mk2 on USBHost for direct sound editing.
- Secondary I2S audio DAC for higher quality balanced outputs.

![a Teensy4.1 and an I2S DAC](./photos/Minimal_UDA1334.jpg)
This DAC does not need a master clock, it has its own PLL to generate it based on the LRCLK1 (WSEL).
So this input is very sensitive to transients. To avoid issues, simply add a 100ohm resistor on the input of the breakout
(it will prevent inductive/capacitive oscillations).

### Teensy4.1 to PCM5102A Breakout
They are quite cheap and high quality dacs.
Most breakouts already have resistors on their inputs to avoid inductive oscillations.
The optional SCK must be grounded by adding a solder blob.

### Installing a secondary I2S DAC for balanced outputs

Connect the secondary I2S like the primary but replace OU1A (7) by OUT1B (32) as an input to the DAC.

### MIDI Din input on RX1
Using a H11L1 optocoupler.
The H11L1 is a fast, reliable and easily available optocoupler.
So a 4k7 pull up resistor is good enough for Midi baud rates.
(Low values can even cause unwanted glitches on the 3V3 rail because of the H11L1 sharp transients).

## Morph Function
Without morph modulation, the morphing from [A0,B0] to [A1,B1] is controlled by the modwheel.
With Morph Mod Depth `CC18` part of the morphing will be controlled by the Morph Function Generator which provides 8 different functions selected by `CC77`
